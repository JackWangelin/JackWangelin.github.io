                        </p>
                        <p>Before arriving at the morale issue, how does one create a brand of ones self? The basics for any company encompass what a personal brand as well.

                            These are the things of a corporate brand. Do people have them as well? When they are trying to get a job they sure  do. Creating a brand can be reframed as preparing to present for a job interview, or even just a project.

                        <p>in every situation, They always present 2 options: buy or don’t buy; pink or blue; on or off; yes or no. I design option c. option c is what you want,  the option that fits, the option that the system abhors, but that fills the vacuum.

This is the part where I’m supposed to tell you how I am going to change the world, save the whales, or the Chihuahuas or whatever the flavour of the week is. I don’t much care about the world. It has been around for about 4.54 billion years, & will continue to exist after humans have abandoned it. It will be fine.

                        <p>
People. 
People on the other hand, could use a good talking to; I want to be the one talking. I want to change how people think through design. By taking their brain by the wrinkles & stuffing option c into their minds, by showing the user what they want can be an option. I want to change how people think. 
                            </p>
                        <p>
Option C
Option c is what you want,  the thing that, when you look at the offerings, you think, “why the hell can’t I just have this waffle with fried chicken and ice cream?” It is the option that fits, the option that the system abhors, but that fills the vacuum between dreams & reality.

                <p>Audience for a business or corporation is a much more straight forward ordeal than trying to define the audience for a person. Companies are working to make money. That means that someone has to buy something from them. Figure out who's buying, & you've made your mark.</p>
                <p>As a person, the direct question is, <blockquote>"who wants to buy me?"</blockquote>
                What a question: how does one sell ones self & figure out who wants to buy. It's a ridiculous thing, even in the context of being hired, "Whom do I want to work for that wants to hire me?" Bloody difficult if you ask us. <h4>For Jack: his audience:</h4>

                    Finally, the personality of a brand. Curiously enough, at the end of the day, this is not something that can really be controlled. You can plan it out, test it out on friends, family & even focus groups, but once it goes live, the internet will have its way with even the bests of brands. <h4>For Jack: His Brand Personality:</h4>

                        When we’re doing business, it’s for the money, so get to the point.</li>

                <p> These points could definitely use some work, & for the final product, they were modified or tossed out.

                    The GA UXDI program initiated their brand strategies with an excercise wherein each student wound up with a personality range statement from each of their peers. Each statement was phased like this,<blockquote>"[i.e.] Jack is ______ and ______, but never ______."</blockquote>

                They can't always be perfect the first time around. The site was designed to direct peopele to the "Option C" section of the philosophy page. During user testing, it was discovered that most people do not scroll down to the lower part of the home page on their first visit, instead, opting to hit the menu button. The final user flow shows how the user is more likely to get to the goal of giving Jack their email address.
