# What is this project?

This is my first & working version of my personal portfolio site. It is also encompassed by my first proper introduction to Github as a useful tool. Previously, I had only used GitHub tangentially & looked in on updates from other people via the webportal.

### A CSS only menu drawer
I must give a *huge* thank you to Jesse Couch & his blog on [http://www.designcouch.com] especially the post on the said, [Pure CSS Drawer Menu](http://www.designcouch.com/home/why/2014/04/23/pure-css-drawer-menu/). It uses a checkbox input type, & its label to show & hide an  `overflow:hidden;` divider. I suggest checking it out. It's very easy to borrow & modify to make your own.

### The Work Section
Now, a shout out to myself: I think about weird things! Watch the experiments `(& take part)`  to blow your mind.

Thanks.

Jack
