# What is this project?

This is my first & working version of my personal portfolio site. It is also encompassed by my first proper introduction to Github as a useful tool. Previously, I had only used GitHub tangentially & looked in on updates from other people via the webportal. 

## Items of interest
- A CSS only menu drawer
- attempting to use pdf.js lib to display my résumé.

### A CSS only menu drawer
I must give a *huge* thank you to Jesse Couch & his blog on [http://www.designcouch.com] especially the post on the said, [Pure CSS Drawer Menu](http://www.designcouch.com/home/why/2014/04/23/pure-css-drawer-menu/). It uses a checkbox input type, & its label to show & hide an  `overflow:hidden;` divider. I suggest checking it out. It's very easy to borrow & modify to make your own.

### PDF.JS
If anyone stumbles across this & happens to have used the [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) I would appriciate some basic help loading a file. I'm not sure if I have to display the viewer in HTML or if I may just call the pdf file. 

The intended result is to be able to have my résumé display when the page loads,as a PDF, so that I can update my résumé by just re-uploading the file.

Thanks.

Jack
