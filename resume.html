            <h4>General Assembly, UX Design Immersive
            </h4>
            <p>Stepping into an immersive course for User experience design at General Assembly provided me with the tools and processes necessary to become a pensive and logic-driven user experience strategist or architect. Building upon the broad range of skills gained in previous professional endeavors, I have been able to fine tune my penchant for planning to ensure that the user is at the center of my designs, without forgoing client goals.</p>

            <p>Working at a small non-profit agency is not unlike working at a startup. When hired, one is aware of the description of the job , but is also keenly aware of how one may be able to apply one’s other skills and knowledge to support or benefit the organization. What I had not expected was the opportunity and ability to learn many more skills that would have been missed in a standard business situation due to the restrictions of stakeholder goals. Others would have been hired, or tasks outsourced: at The Chamber, we had to figure it out ourselves.</p>

            <p>Being accepted into a mentorship is likely the optimum method to start ones professional career path. As a part of this marketing and rebranding firm, I was launched into managing multiple client project within weeks of beginning, creating SEO strategies, managing client relations, and re-engineering web page layouts to meet conversion goals. By the end of three months, I managed four clients, including the full rebranding of the Face the Future charity gala, as well as created new internal processes to streamline account management.</p>

            <p>Building a company, and more interestingly, producing an idea, teaches one more than four years of college could. Building a company from the ground up means more than just dedicating all of one’s time and efforts to this idea. One must additionally build a team, find funding to keep moving forward, test the market waters, and finally take the leap of faith. Learning how to lead, manage, and most importantly, how to let go (it’s not a baby, it’s a business), allows for effective progress towards measurable goals outside of the laboratory setting. </p>
