            <h3>Option C.</h3>
                <p>Option C is what you want,  the thing that, when you look at the offerings, you think, “why the hell can’t I just have this waffle with fried chicken and ice cream?” It is the option that fits, the option that the system abhors, but that fills the vacuum between dreams & reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Option C is the result of a lifetime of not really getting what I want. The cool new thing comes out, but you don't really own it. The oldest most dependable thing in your toolkit won't take chances to experiment, to update, or create something new. 
                </p>    
                <p>
                    The need to deal with reality it what drives Option C. A business must make money, the customer doesn't want to wait; teleportation would solve all of our travel issues, but the possibility of atomic incongruity is terrifying, & the technology doesn't exist.
                    <blockquote>What does exist?</blockquote>
                    Option C exists. With enough thought & planning so you're not wasting your time testing options 'd' through 'y.' With enough flexibility to prevent your business model depending on planned obsolescence; with the right amount of confidence to prevent Option <b>X</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't want to deliver hits. I want to deliver a classic. I want to design your Option C.

                <p>People could use a good talking to;<wbr> I want to be the one talking. I want to change how people think through design. By taking their brain by the wrinkles & stuffing option c into their minds, by showing the user what they want can be an option. I will change how people think.

            <h3>ATMs.</h3> 
                    <p>I hate ATMs.</p>
                    <p>I won't go too far down the hellhole that is the experience that is the "Automated Teller Machine." Perhaps it's the grand idea that it costs a person money to access their own money...

                            &nbsp; exemplifies that reminds me that I should keep working on my telekinetic prowess, such that I would be able to reconfigure matter at will to solve this absurd issue. 
                    </p>   
            <p>
                ATMs are supposed to resolve the issue of not always having a bank nearby to withdraw money. Now, we each have our bank in our pockets. The reasons to transact with physical currency are dwindling, except, EXCEPT, where & when the banking industry has decided it's required to be the middle man: my friend & I don't use the same bank, so we can't electronically transfer funds without a fee (or multitudinous), or you're aware that your waiter, along with the kitchen staff, bussers, & other restaurant staff, are losing significant portions of their income (why doesn't minimum wage cover their salaries) when you don't tip in cash, or   you're buying some pot & neither you nor your drug dealer want a record of that transaction.
            </p>
            <p>This is the beginning of the tour of my own version of Dante's Inferno. The ATM is the tip of the terrible terrible iceberg that is the craptacular user experience that is the banking & finance industry.</p>
