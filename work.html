                    <span class="lead">You're doing work for me. Right now.
                </span>
                You've been randomly presented with one of three different stylesheets. The only variance between these style sheets are the background & text colours. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why, you ask? Eye-strain. Aren't you tired of reading black text on a bright white lightbulb? Have you purchased "computer glasses" or blue-blocker already? Are your eyeballs drying-out, shriviling to one tenth of their natural size, from your unblinking dedication to reading on a computer screen?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am. I have. Mine Do. I want a better reading & legibility experience on a computer screen. I think there is a better option to create that perceived contrast, I think there is an option c. Help me find it.

                        During the 6th week of the General Assembly UXDI Immersive Program, we were discussing visual design in user experience, & thus having been bequeathed an ultimatum,
                    </p> 
                    <blockquote>
“The purpose of visual design is to create a positive user experience through a usable and pleasurable user interface,”
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
I decided that needed to be challenged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
What about the opposite? What about a negative user experience (through an unusable & disagreeable interface) & what would it’s purpose be?
                    </p>
                    <p>
The discussion resulted in no examples & the blasé conclusion that as long as the experience/interface is being design to complete a goal, the design has accomplished its purpose. Even if the design is difficult to use, & creates a poor user experience, by accomplishing the goal, it becomes an example of ‘good’ user experience design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The theme of the discussion was benevolent v. nefarious design, but it got the old gears churning. How would one create a user experience that is has a maleficent intent, for a negative purpose? </p>

If you’re not familiar with Markov chains, Wikipedia Markov chains. If that didn’t make any sense, the basic idea is that a Markov chain models the progression through states & describes the probability of state change in a system wherein any state can be reached from any other state, within a set of conditions.

                        <p>Markov chains mathmatically describe the probability of a series of events, each with a condition.<wbr>Wikipedia has a wealth of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_Markov_chains">Examples of Markov Chains</a>.</p>

The Site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
One page, 3 buttons: ‘A’ ‘B’ ‘C.’ Clicking ‘A’ presents the same set of buttons, but in a well design user experience. Clicking ‘B’ presents them, but manipulates the user into selecting a certain option. Selecting ‘C’ presents the options, but randomizes to which state each directs the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Important to the idea of progress is some user interaction. Perhaps a 99¢ payment; maybe just a captcha form: some action that is intrinsically or at least practically, irreversible.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
What’s the point?
                    </p>
                    <p>
The point is that I (the creator of the site) am not defining the goal, & therefore, there can be an intrinsically bad user-experience, not just a crappy design that doesn’t accomplish a goal. It removes morality from the user experience design, again, allowing for a truly negative user experience. It’s also not a loop, so the user is, in fact, progressing, just without an end goal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
The result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Perhaps all this will accomplish is an artistic statement on life, or a magnificent thought experiment. I am hoping it will provide a place to start exploring definitive ‘bad’ user experience design.
